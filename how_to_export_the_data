The data is stored in a Postgres 9.3 database. This database can be created by importing the dump in the bp_areas.tar file.
Note that the PostGIS extension must be enabled!


When creating a csv dump to be imported in the NDS, proceed as follows:

1. First recreate the geojson column. We need to delete repeating points as they will trip ElasticSearch:

UPDATE bp_areas
SET geojson = CAST(ST_AsGeoJSON(ST_MakeValid(ST_RemoveRepeatedPoints(ST_GeomFromGeoJSON(ST_AsGeoJSON(the_geom,9))))) AS JSON);

2. The data can be exported using the following query, wrapped in a COPY () TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER statement:

SELECT 
	gid, 
	CASE 
		WHEN 
			type = 'Nature' 
		THEN 
			CONCAT(locality, ' (',  source, ')') 
		ELSE
			locality 
	END 
		AS locality,
	geojson,
	iso,
	source,
	type,
	locality_nl
FROM bp_areas;
